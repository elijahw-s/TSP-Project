# TSP-Project

By Elijah Whitlam-Sandler

These codes are meant to go through random permutations in search for the hamiltonian path with the smallest weight in a given weighted graph of cities. There is no efficient algoritm to determine the shortest hamiltonian path so these codes attempt to find this path by going through a set amount of random permutations of the orders of the cities, and then determining the path length for any given permutation.

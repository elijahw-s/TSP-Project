# TSP-Project

By Elijah Whitlam-Sandler

These codes are meant to go through random permutations in search for the hamiltonian path with the smallest weight in a given weighted graph of cities. There is no efficient algoritm to determine the shortest hamiltonian path so these codes attempt to find this path by going through a set amount of random permutations of the orders of the cities, and then determining the path length for any given permutation. Even though this method goes through many points in search for the shortest path (I've tested it with 10,000,000 different permutations) there is no gaurentee that this is the shortest path, as there are, for the challenge.tsv, 6.08 E+62 different hamiltonian paths that the salesman can travel, thus testing 10,000,000 is approximately 0% of total number of paths.
